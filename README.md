# QrCodeApp1
A QRCode generator for Mac and Linux which is made in C# using SkiaSharp. It asks for text to encode in the QRCode and filename to save it as a PNG.

## Getting started
1. Have .NET 6 installed.
2. Create a new Visual Studio Code project.
3. Add the dependencies SkiaSharp (for graphics on Mac), SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux (for graphics on Linux) and Net.Codecrete.QrCodeGenerator (for methods to generate QrCode) as NuGet packages for this.
4. Copy the program from the source folder.
5. Run the program then.

## Other
Visual Studio Code doesn't have a dedicated way of installing NuGet packages but there are extensions which allow that such as [NuGet Package Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmrog.vscode-nuget-package-manager). It really speeds up work.
